Messaging Program
<p>Big picture user story</p> 

The users will use my app to send instant messages to each other.  The messages can consist of text, pictures, or videos.  When a message is opened, the user will get a “read” report.  Also, each message gets a time stamp.    

<p>Small picture user story (1st step)</p>

The user opens the messaging app.  The prompt says “Enter recipient name”.  The user types the name of the person who they want to talk to and presses enter.  The next prompt says “Type message”.  The user then types their message and presses enter.  If the message is sent successfully, then the prompt says “Message sent to (recipient name)”.  If it does not send successfully, then the prompt says “Error: Message not sent”.

<p> Testing plan </p>
Prompt says enter username, user types"user".  Next, the prompt asks "who do you want to send your message to?" and the user types "student1".  Lastly, the prompt says "Message has been sent to student1".

<p> reflections and revisions </p>

I had to revise the code multiple times until it would properly send the message.  I had some trouble with getting the program to say "message has been sent to student1".  Sometimes it would say "message has been sent to "user".  I realized that in order to fix this issue, I neeeded to give a name to the variable that was assigned to "student1".

<p> next steps </p>
 (create a list of messages; sender,reciever, and message)
 The sender is the prompt, the reciever is the name of the student who recieves the message.  The message is what's being sent between the students.  It can say whatever the student wants it to say.
